I would like to thank my supervisors, Michael Veall and Pau Pujolas, who skillfully guided me through my research endeavours. I would also like to thank Gajendran Raveendranathan, for his insights, especially in the writing and computational programming for Chapter 3. Thank you to the people at the Canadian Centre for Data Development and Economic Research (CDER) for making the data used in Chapter 2 available for research and for all the helpful comments I received during my time there. Thank you as well to the people at the Department of Economics of the University of Minnesota, especially Tim Kehoe who helped me devise the ideas for Chapters 2 and 3 of my thesis. The knowledge and discussions I was able to engage in during my time at the department proved invaluable to my success.

I would like to acknowledge the funding received from the Productivity Partnership as supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. It made it possible to access the data that was critical in the analysis for Chapter 2.

Special thanks to others who have offered advice throughout my years as a doctoral student. In no particular order, Professors Svetlana Demidova, Cesar Sosa-Padilla, Arthur Sweetman, Alok Johri, Jeff Racine, Bettina Brueggemann, Stephen Jones and Phil DeCicca. As well as students Khuong Trong (the real HLP), Karen Bravo, Mahbub Rahman, Terry Yip, Muhebullah Karimzada, Shaun Shaikh, Farhana Khanam, Sean Sexton, Luc Clair, Grant Gibson, John Kealey, Natalie Malak, Nadine Chami, Anthony Hong and Zvez Todorov. A special thank to James Spencer who, among many other contributions, created this McMaster thesis template in *R Markdown* allowing for seamless formatting of this document.

Finally, I am thankful for the love and support of my parents and grandfather who always encouraged my academic endeavours. Also, to my aunts and uncles who have played a role in my life; Lise, Monique, Jacques, Darcie, Danny and Lisa. And to my best friend Set. 

This thesis is dedicated to my late mother Ginette Houle who taught me about courage and tenacity and who supported my fascination with science and mathematics at a young age.
